## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-13

### Highlights
- Enhanced developer UX for interactions: fluent Slash Command builder, Modal support with Text Inputs, and Message Component builders.
- Rich Presence upgrade: full activity model including buttons, with simple `setStatus` and `setActivity` helpers.
- Reliability: confirmed heartbeat timing and reconnect logic per Discord guidance (jitter, ACK check-before-send, indefinite backoff).

### Added
- Slash Commands
  - `SlashCommandBuilder` with option helpers (string/integer/number/boolean/user/channel/role/mentionable/attachment) and choices.
  - End-to-end REST support for application commands: list/create/delete, bulk overwrite (global and guild).
- Interactions: Modals
  - `InteractionResponseType.modal (=9)` and `DiscordClient.createInteractionModal(...)` helper.
  - `MessageComponent.textInput` (type 4) with `TextInput.Style` and validation helpers.
- Message Components
  - Fluent builders: `ComponentsBuilder`, `ActionRowBuilder`, `ButtonBuilder`, `SelectMenuBuilder`, `TextInputBuilder`.

  - Expanded `PresenceUpdatePayload.Activity` with `state`, `details`, `timestamps`, `assets`, `party`, `secrets`, and `buttons`.
  - `ActivityBuilder` for composing rich activities, plus `setStatus(_:)` and `setActivity(...)` helpers.

### Fixed
- Gateway heartbeat loop sends before sleeping and includes initial jitter.
- Reconnect attempts are retried indefinitely with exponential backoff (capped) while allowed.
