## [0.6.1] - 2025-11-12

### Highlights
- ShardingGatewayManager Phase 2 complete: per-shard presence, event streams, staggered connects, guild distribution verification.
- Phase 2 Day 4: graceful shutdown and resume metrics, plus health APIs and docs.

### Added
- ShardingGatewayManager
  - Per-shard presence via configuration callbacks with fallback.
  - Per-shard filtered event streams: `events(for:)`, `events(for: [Int])`.
  - Staggered connection mode with batch pacing respecting identify concurrency.
  - Guild distribution verification after all shards READY.
  - Graceful shutdown: `disconnect()` sets shutdown gate, prevents reconnects, closes shards concurrently, clears `/gateway/bot` cache.
  - Health surfaces: `healthCheck()` aggregate metrics and `shardHealth(id:)` snapshots including resume metrics.
  - Restart API: `restartShard(_:)`.
- GatewayClient
  - Resume metrics: success/failure counters, last attempt/success timestamps.
  - `RESUMED` handling and `INVALID_SESSION` fallback with gated reconnects.
  - Reconnect gating via `setAllowReconnect(_:)`.
- REST Endpoints
  - Stickers: `getSticker`, `listStickerPacks`, `listGuildStickers`, `getGuildSticker`.
  - Forum helper: `createForumThread(...)`.
  - Auto Moderation: list/get/create/modify/delete rules.
  - Scheduled Events: list/create/get/modify/delete and list interested users.
  - Stage Instances: create/get/modify/delete.
  - Audit Logs: `getGuildAuditLog(...)`.
  - Invites & Templates: create/list/delete and template CRUD/list/sync.
- Docs
  - README: Setup & Configuration (Windows notes, env vars, intents, logging), Sharding section, Advanced Features, Production sharding config, Health Monitoring, Graceful Shutdown.
  - Tests
    - Initial sharding tests: configuration defaults, staggered delay, shard formula, ShardedEvent wrapper.

### Changed
- ShardingGatewayManager initializer split configuration concerns:
  - `init(token:configuration:intents:httpConfiguration:)` where `configuration` is sharding options and `httpConfiguration` is HTTP/Gateway config.
- README examples updated to match API and new initializer defaults.

### Fixed
- Prevent reconnect loops during shutdown by gating reconnect attempts.
- Handle `INVALID_SESSION` by clearing session/seq and performing clean re-identify.
- Track `RESUMED` to mark READY and record metrics.

### Notes
- Voice/multipart sticker upload remain deferred.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-11

### Highlights
- Minreqs readiness: broad REST coverage (minus voice), advanced gateway (resume/reconnect), robust rate limiting, professional README/docs, examples, and CI.

### Added
- Slash Commands
  - Typed routing via `SlashCommandRouter` with subcommand path resolution and typed accessors (string/int/bool/double).
  - Full management: create/list/delete/bulk-overwrite for global and guild commands.
  - Options: all official types and `choices` support.
  - Permissions: `default_member_permissions`, `dm_permission` via `ApplicationCommandCreate`.
- Gateway & Stability
  - `GatewayClient` converted to an actor; serialized event handling via `EventDispatcher` actor.
  - Reconnect with exponential backoff; preserve shard across reconnects; non-fatal decode errors.
- Sharding
  - `loginAndConnectSharded(index:total:)` and `ShardManager` to orchestrate multiple shards.
- REST Coverage
  - Channels: get/modify/name edit, create/delete, list messages, permissions edit/delete, bulk channel positions, typing indicator.
  - Guilds: get/modify settings (verification, notifications, system channel, content filter), widget get/modify, prune count/begin, list channels.
  - Members: get/list/modify (nick, roles).
  - Roles: list/create/modify/delete, bulk role positions.
  - Messages: send/edit (content/embeds/components), get, list.
  - Interactions: responses with content or embeds; generic response type enum.
  - Webhooks: create/execute/list/get/modify/delete.
  - Bans: list/create/delete.
- Models
  - Rich `Embed` (author/footer icon/thumbnail/image/timestamp/fields).
  - `Message` includes `embeds`, `attachments`, `mentions`, `components`.
  - `MessageComponent` (ActionRow, Button, SelectMenu).
  - `Interaction` includes guild_id and nested command options with types.
  - `Guild`, `Channel`, `GuildMember`, `Role`, `Webhook`, `GuildBan`, `GuildWidgetSettings` expanded.
- Cross-Platform & CI

  - GitHub Actions CI for macOS and Windows; code coverage artifact and README badge.
- High-Level API & Utilities
  - `CommandRouter` and `SlashCommandRouter` with `onError` callbacks.
  - `BotUtils`: message chunking, mention/prefix helpers.
- Docs & Examples
  - README: minreqs checklist, Distinct Value section, Production Deployment section, polished header/buttons.
  - Examples: Ping, Prefix Commands, Slash bot.

### Changed
- Rate limiter: fixed bucket reset handling; rely on response headers post-reset.
- REST/HTTP: improved headers and robustness; retries/backoff tuned.
- Event processing: moved to actor for serial handling; simplified client sinks.

### Removed
- Phase 5 roadmap (testing/benchmarks) from README per project direction; Production Deployment section added instead.

### Notes
- Voice is optional and not required for listing; future work may add voice gateway/UDP/audio.
