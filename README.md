```swift
import SwiftDisc

@main
struct MyFirstBot {
    static func main() async {
        let token = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"] ?? ""
        let client = DiscordClient(token: token)
        
        do {
            try await client.loginAndConnect(intents: [.guilds, .guildMessages, .messageContent])
            
            for await event in client.events {
                switch event {
                case .ready(let info):
                    print("✅ Bot is online as \(info.user.username)!")
                    
                case .messageCreate(let message) where message.content == "!hello":
                    try await client.sendMessage(
                        channelId: message.channel_id,
                        content: "👋 Hello, \(message.author.username)!"
                    )
                    
                default:
                    break
                }
            }
        } catch {
